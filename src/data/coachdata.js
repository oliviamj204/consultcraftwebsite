    history: "Ashish Raman Sethi's journey to becoming India's first Muay Thai champion at Bangla Stadium began with an entirely different dream. The Haryana native had represented his state in cricket and harbored ambitions of playing in the IPL. He tried out for under-16, under-19, and under-25 teams, dedicating years to pursuing his cricket aspirations. However, after struggling to make a breakthrough by age 22, his cricket career came to an unexpected end, leaving him uncertain about his future path. After taking a long break to reassess his goals, Ashish discovered martial arts at the relatively late age of 24-25. Though he initially felt it was \"too late\" to start a new combat sport, this decision would prove to be the turning point that would transform him into one of India's most celebrated Muay Thai fighters.",
    journey: "Starting his martial arts journey at a local gym with fundamental kickboxing training, Ashish quickly realized his potential and hunger for improvement. His dedication paid off as he began accumulating victories in amateur boxing competitions. The breakthrough came in 2018 when he won the KFI kickboxing national championship, followed by his first gold medal at the Muay Thai National Championships in 2019. His most significant amateur achievement came in 2020 when he won India's first-ever bronze medal at the IFMA World Championship in Korea, defeating Chinese Taipei's Jhao Cyun Ciou in the Elite Category. This historic victory established him as one of India's premier Muay Thai talents.",

During his third professional fight in a top Thai boxing league in Thailand, he suffered a severe jaw injury that would change his perspective on the sport forever. Rather than ending his career, this traumatic experience became a catalyst for his greatest achievements. After recovering from his jaw injury, Ashish won 8 out of 14 professional fights, demonstrating remarkable resilience and determination. His comeback culminated in his historic victory at Bangla Stadium, where he became the first Indian to win the prestigious championship belt with the fastest knockout of the night.",
