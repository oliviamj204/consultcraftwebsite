    <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
    <p>
      At ConsultCraft Inc., we recognized a fundamental problem in the global coaching industry: despite being worth over $16 billion,
      talented coaches worldwide were trapped by geographical limitations, losing up to 40% of their earnings to middlemen, and struggling
      to scale beyond their local reach. We knew there had to be a better way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Founded with the mission to democratize coaching and unlock human potential globally, ConsultCraft Inc. emerged from a simple yet
      powerful belief: expertise should know no boundaries. We watched brilliant coaches limited by location, exceptional athletes unable
      to access the best training, and passionate fitness professionals struggling to turn their skills into sustainable careers.
    </p>
    <p>That's when SportsCove was born!</p>
